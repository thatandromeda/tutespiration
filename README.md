We were all liking [Inspirobot](https://inspirobot.me) on Twitter and [my coworker @aamcnamara thought it would be funny](https://twitter.com/aamcnamara/status/880826274662449152) if you got a free inspirational poster with every MIT Libraries catalog search.

I can't do that(*) but now we can pretend I did; you can search the "catalog" and get a lovely inspirational poster with a quote from a real MIT thesis. [Here](https://tutespiration.herokuapp.com/2) [are](https://tutespiration.herokuapp.com/3) [a](https://tutespiration.herokuapp.com/4) [few](https://tutespiration.herokuapp.com/5) [examples](https://tutespiration.herokuapp.com/6).

(*) this is a lie; I have write access to the [https://libraries.mit.edu/](https://libraries.mit.edu/) repository and I trust I could figure out the deployment keys and maybe if I brought in really good cookies my coworkers would look the other way. But. You know. I _shouldn't_.
