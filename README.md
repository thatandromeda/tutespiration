We were all liking [Inspirobot](https://inspirobot.me) on Twitter and [@aamcnamara thought it would be funny](https://twitter.com/aamcnamara/status/880826274662449152) if you got a free inspirational poster with every catalog search.

I can't do that(*) but now we can pretend I did; you can search the 'MIT Libraries catalog' and get a lovely inspirational poster with a quote from a real MIT thesis. [Here's one of my favorites.](https://tutespiration.herokuapp.com/1/11566/hAV_4Cl-jJg/)

(*) this is a lie; I have write access to the [https://libraries.mit.edu/](https://libraries.mit.edu/) repository and I trust I could figure out the deployment keys and maybe if I brought in really good cookies my coworkers would look the other way. But. You know. I _shouldn't_.
